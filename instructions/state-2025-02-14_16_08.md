We've built a Home Assistant integration for Ostrom Energy that fetches and displays electricity prices. The integration includes seven sensors: current spot price, average price, lowest/highest prices, next hour price, and timestamps for lowest/highest prices. The core functionality works with proper timezone handling, price calculations, and automatic updates every 30 minutes. Key files are sensor.py (sensor logic), config_flow.py (configuration UI), and translation files in translations/.
Current issues include: timezone offset in the highest price time sensor, localization not working for configuration UI fields despite having proper translation files, and a deprecation warning in the options flow handler. We've attempted fixes for timezone handling by ensuring proper UTC/local time conversions throughout the data chain and tried to implement proper localization in the config flow, but these solutions haven't fully resolved the issues.
The codebase uses Home Assistant's DataUpdateCoordinator pattern for efficient updates, implements proper error handling, and includes extensive debug logging. Recent changes focused on timezone handling in PowerPriceData class, translation structure updates, and config flow improvements. Critical areas to watch: timezone conversions (especially in price time calculations), translation key matching between code and translation files, and proper initialization of the OptionsFlow handler to avoid deprecation warnings.
